To build, compile [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (if you made changes) to CSS and then run a local web server (HTML/JS) however you like. 

I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) extensions. Press *Watch Sass* in the bottom toolbar to compile Sass and *Go Live* to launch the web server.

The vis was tested for Chrome so you may find visual bugs in other browsers.
