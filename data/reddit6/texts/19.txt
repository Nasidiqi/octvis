I was in a coma for three days. Unlike most people I definitely knew time was passing, but didn't know I was in a coma. I kept having weird hallucinations about running a restaurant with my brother, and I kept getting confused and wondering where I was and why I wasn’t managing the restaurant. I’ve never worked at a restaurant and I’m not sure why my brother was involved. Life didn’t feel real for a few months following waking up.  
edit: "dreams" to "hallucinations" because it fits better
