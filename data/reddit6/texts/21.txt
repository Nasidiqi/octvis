This is really bizzare, but my uncle, a very serious, strict and rather dry man had an accident and went into coma few years back. He never believed anything he couldn't touch, no talks about souls or anything similar. He was in coma for a few weeks until he woke up and had this crazy af story. He said he saw himself in a bubble, floating around in a white place and it was peaceful and beautiful. But then he said about other bubbles he could see around him. All of them had other people in them. He distinctly remembered a black haired woman singing in the bubble closest to his untill one day her bubble bursted and she disappeared. When he woke up He could give a very clear description of her body, age all that. Now the crazy bit... There was a woman,one floor below him, in a coma that sadly had passed away before he woke up. You guessed it - black hair, age, body all correct. He had never met or seen this woman in his life. His whole idea of life changed after this.

It still makes me think sometimes... Where was he? He thinks all the people in bubbles around him were patients in the same hospital. Could it be? We'll probably never know
