My mom was in a coma and she recently told me it was horrible.

She was in a wreck that killed her technically 5+ times (heart stopped) and she said she could feel all the pain, hear the doctors yelling that she was being coded, she said she thought to herself "wow whoever that it must be dying" and then realizing it was her.

She was trying to scream and tell them she was alive, but nothing ever came out.

Edit for clarification:

When i said she was clinically dead 5 times I was just detailing the severity of the situation. She was in a coma right after that for a really long time and described the inability to scream, hearing people, pain etc.. from while she was in the coma.
