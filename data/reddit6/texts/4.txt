Dunno. I was in a coma for 11 days, severe brain injury. I don’t remember being in a coma or waking up from a coma. I lost several years of memories prior to the coma, and my brain didn’t really start to “retain” information again until ~6 weeks after I came out of the coma. 

I’m told that my personality changed afterwards. I had to rebuild most areas of my life. It sucked, but it was probably a good thing. 

Although I’d be lying if I said I never wondered what my life would be like if I’d never had the coma.
