My brother-in-law was in a coma for a month after a car accident in which he lost his eye and almost died.

He's said that he had a vision of "God" holding him underwater three times, almost drowning him the third time, then him giving up and finally being let up into his home town.

He's had one almost fatal accident after that, and while I'm not superstitious, I do believe sometimes reality can echo the future in ways which our minds can perceive sometimes, even if we can't fully interpret those echoes. Well, I simply believe he's eventually going to have a third accident. I fear for him.
