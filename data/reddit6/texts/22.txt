I was out for 45 days, no white light, no tunnel, nothing. Woke up and couldn't remember who I was. For six months, never really fully recovered so I just started life again. Turns out I'm a completely different person than I was and that is a really good thing. I get memories now and then, they aren't pleasant. A woman came and sat by my bed for six weeks, turns out she was my ex lover. I couldn't remember her. Didn't recognize my mother. 

\*\*\* Afterward\*\* This is the second time in my life I have related this much about my life publicly and it has been good and at the same time really painful. Thanks to everyone for being kind. I wrote this story seven months ago and published it in the lounge and I really hurt my self doing it. This time I wanted to share about the life afterwards and I hope it has been of some benefit to others that struggle with mental issues. This place saves lives, gives hope and guidance to millions of people and i feel lucky to be part of the community.
