About 3 years ago I overdosed on sleeping pills and it caused me to go into a coma. I remember a lot of what my family said but one thing stood out, my dads voice. I remember him saying “I love you and I know you miss your mom and brother but I still need you”. I was in that damn coma for a month and I woke up five minutes after he said that. I couldn’t speak because I had tubes down my throat and I was non verbal for a while after because the pills messed up my brain, I don’t know how I remembered but I remembered the slang sign for I love you. I still struggle with suicide but any time I think about it I remember what my dad said and I try to do the opposite of what I was going to do. 

Edit: I never thought I’d get this many replies. I’m a woman by the way. I actually talked to my dad today and we argued a bit about me not wanting to go to the hospital, he said he could hear it in my voice that I’m not really doing too good. But I told him I’d be ok but I don’t think he believes it. I will be I just got to keep busy and deal.
