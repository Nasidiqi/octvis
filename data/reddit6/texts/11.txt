I was put in an induced coma when I was 9 years old after a pretty bad car accident which left me with a fractured skull. All I remember is a bad dream about having a bad headache, and hearing my older sister telling everyone, including my parents, to get the fuck out of her way because she wanted to see me. I found out later that this was on the night it happened, and they were trying to calm her down before she saw me.

Edit: For those who are telling me to let her know how awesome she is, I made sure to, not quite but almost, hug the life out of her when she got back from work.
