My friend was in a coma about ten years ago for roughly three weeks.  Car accident.  When he woke up we visited him and when I was alone with him he told me it was like a lucid dream.  The real world was gone and he felt like he was in a world he could create himself for years.  He was dead serious too, he talked on and on about how he had a slight understanding that he was not in the real world anymore and that he thought he might be in heaven.  About how he felt like he was actually dying and his last few second just stretched on and on forever.  He said that's what it felt like.  He mentioned that he could fly (in the coma dream) and that it was amazing.  He spent a little while in the hospital, then went home, did physical therapy for about two weeks before killing himself with pain pills and vodka.  People thought the pain was too much, that it was an accidental overdose, or that the therapy and the accident made him feel helpless and depressed.  Honestly, I think he wanted back into his lucid dream world.  The way he talked about it was like the best thing he ever experienced.
