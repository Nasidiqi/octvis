I was in a medically induced coma following a self-inflicted gunshot wound. I don't remember much but my family described moments of me appearing to be awake. Most notable, an apparent attempt at humor. Apparently they put these mits on my hands to prevent me from ripping my ventilation tubes out over and over but I pretended they were my lobster claws. I have no recollection but it's a real me move.

Edit: Gold was really too generous. Thank you so much. It's also my first gold, so big hugs to you, Stranger.

Edit 2: I've never known so much kindness. Truly. My heart is very full right now.
