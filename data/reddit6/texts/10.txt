I'm not sure where I read it, but a girl talked about her experience and she mentioned that it was like going in and out of sleeping/dreaming. Just when she would feel like she was waking up, she could hear parts of conversations or the TV, but she would slip right back to 'sleeping'. She also said when people would clean her she could feel them touch sensitive parts of her like her armpit and butthole area. 

I'm an inpatient phlebotomist and even though some of my patients are sedated I still always introduce myself and say I'm here to draw some blood, just incase they could hear me.
